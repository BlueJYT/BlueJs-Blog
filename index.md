## Yup, I'm making a blog using Github Pages

And it uses Markdown, which I think is pretty nice, since I'm already very familiar with it.
### Github Flavored Markdown!
Whatever that means, like what... it's a special type of Markdown? I mean I don't mind it being different, but it's kinda confusing saying it like that. But anyway, the best part is that I can easily import stuff using my very special tool StackEdit (not sponsered) and deploy edits anytime I want to easily.
### Dynamic Pages?
It's unlikely unless I figure out Google Firebases (which is super generous given that I'm on a completely free plan)
### Ads?
Only a one at the bottom of pages, I don't want to intrude on you a bunch
### Anything Else?
Ehh... maybe
