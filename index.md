## Yup, I'm making a blog using Github Pages

And it uses Markdown, which I think is pretty nice, since I'm already very familiar with it.
### It's Github flavored
Whatever that means, like what... it's a special type of Markdown? I mean I don't mind it being different, but it's kinda confusing saying it like that. But anyway, the best part is that I can easily import stuff using my very special tool StackEdit (not sponsered) and deploy edits anytime I want to easily.
